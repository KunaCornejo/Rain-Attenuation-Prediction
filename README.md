# Rain Attenuation Prediction
# Author: Andres Cornejo ©2020, UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL AUTONOMA DE MEXICO
The main objective is to train and validate the proposed models based on LSTM networks by using artificial rain attenuation time-series at the input. The time-series were obtained from ITU-R P.1853 by ONERA (https://github.com/KunaCornejo/ITU-R-P.1853).
This deep learning code was developed in the thesis: "Implementation of Machine Learning Techniques to Optimize the Ground Segment for High Throughput Satellite Systems in Q/V Band", by Andres Cornejo, UNAM ©2020
